Megan Regan tries to make the case that there is a connection between pursuit of perfect penmanship and the skills brought to the labor market (human capital)

Penmanship reflects a time and a place, the country or year you were born, the language you speak, the alphabet you use and supposedly also your personality.

In the pre-industrial revolution era, in the US the Spencer method was taught. This method took thousands of hours to perfect yet those who could write in the Specer method were labeled as "model citizens". The Spencer method was the script of business so ppl who wanted to comunicated in the world of business had to know the spencer method.

After the industrial revolution, due to the technological and economic changes a new kind of penmanship method was required, a more efficient one meant to keep pace with the typewriter. This method was called the Palmer method.
The typewriter also inclusion of women into the business-sphere due to their perceived competitive advantage of nimble fingers.

Later on, in the 1970's, where information and global communication became the central point in business and with that the last formal style of penmanship taught in the US come about, the Zaner-Bloser method. This utilitarian method focused on teaching manuscript first to allow earlier communication in children to reflect that the needs of the market at the time were all about communication.

Fast forward to today, penmanship is not necessarily taught in school anymore


Empirical research on handwriting -> The written word is more eficcient in terms of memory and learning outcome than the typed word.

The relevant skills are the time you invest in yourself pursuing your perfection
