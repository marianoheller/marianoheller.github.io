So we may ask ourself, was all this time invested in developing perfect penmanship wasted? Megan Regan states that the most important skill is the investment of time by itself, the pursuit of perfection, and makes the case that there is a connection between the pursuit of perfect penmanship and the skills brought to the labor market.</p>\n<p>Penmanship reflects a time and a place, the country or year you were born, the language you speak, the alphabet you use. In the pre industrial revolution era, in the US the Spencer method was taught. This method took thousands of hours to master yet those who could write in the Specer method were labeled as \"model citizens\". The Spencer method was the script of business so people who wanted to comunicate in the world of business had to know the Spencer method.</p>\n<p>After the industrial revolution, due to the technological and economic changes a new kind of penmanship method was required, a more efficient method meant to keep pace with the typewriter. It was called the Palmer method. </p>\n<p>Later on, in the 1970's, where information and global communication became the central point in business the last formal style of penmanship taught in the US came about, the Zaner-Bloser method. This utilitarian method focused on teaching manuscript first to allow earlier communication in children to reflect that the needs of the market at the time were all about communication.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to today, penmanship is not necessarily taught in school anymore while cursive, if taught, is taught in the art department. So the question arises, was all the time invested in pursuing a perfect penmanship wasted? Empirical research on handwriting indicates that the written word is more eficcient in terms of memory and learning outcome than the typed word, so at least we can say that the written work still has relevance in our modern day.</p>\n<p>People who have invested a lot of time in pursuing their perfect penmanship also wonder if their skills are now obsolete or no longer relevant for the labor market. Megan claims that the relevant skills for the labor market are the time you invest in yourself, those thousands of hours that you spend pursuing your perfection and not the penmanship itself.</p>\n<h2>My thoughts</h2>\n<p>Megan Regan tries to make the case that there is a connection between the pursuit of perfect penmanship and the human capital. Along the talk she also presents several different questions such as if the time invested in pursuing a perfect penmanship was wasted or not, or if the people who have invested said time on perfecting their penmanship offer obsolete skills to the labor market.\nHowever the only scientific proof she brings up is the empirical research done on handwritten letter in regards to learning outcome and memory, which doesn't really adresses the main topic.\nIn the end the speaker affirms, without any evidence, that all the time used in pursuit of perfect penmanship was not wasted due to fact that they were spent pursuing perfection, basically asserting her own statement by repeating it in a different intonation.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"The pursuit of perfect penmanship",path:"/blog/the-pursuit-of-perfect-penmanship",date:"April 12, 2018"}}},{node:{html:"<p>In the last few years the world of work has seen a dramatic change as the frequency of communication between clients, vendors and/or fellow employees from different countries increased considerably. This, in turn, brought to the surface the vast contrast in communication styles between cultures and the problems generated by it. Coming across as abrupt or non-caring is one of many possible issues that could arise from neglecting this subject.</p>\n<p>One study examined nearly 7500 questionnaire responses from managers and executives across 12 countries targeting 39 key personality traits, and compiled them into what they called \"The Big Five\": emotional balance, extroversion, consentiusness, agreableness and openness to new experiences.</p>\n<p>The researchers have also noted that agreeableness and emotional balance account for the biggest disparities. For instance, business leaders in the UK had among the lowest scores on agreeableness, received average scores in emotional balance and got high scores in extroversion. On the other hand, managers and executives in Japan scored high in emotional balance and very low in extroversion. This might lead, for example, to an engineer from the UK facing some awkward silences when traveling to Asia or a Chinese manager in America putting his foot in it by asking the wrong questions.</p>\n<p>But these are not the only criteria on the subject. Another author classified said differences into 8 scales: communicating, evaluating, leading, deciding, trusting, disagreeing and scheduling. These scales, for instance 'evaluating', range from one end of the spectrum, direct negative feedback, to the other, indirect negative feedback. The main purpose behind this is to allow both parties to consider where they fall in these scales and help them to adapt accordingly.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, while there may be many ways to categorize and analize these discrepancies in behaviour and communication styles, it's worth noting that being aware of them and adapting around them is crucial to succeed in interacting with people from different cultures.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Communicating across cultures",path:"/blog/communicating-across-cultures",date:"March 29, 2018"}}}]}},pathContext:{}}}});
