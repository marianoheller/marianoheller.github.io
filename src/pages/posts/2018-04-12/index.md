## Summary

With the pass of time, as technology moves forward, we are seeing the dissapearance of the pen as the main tool in the bussines world. So we may ask ourself, was all this time invested in developing perfect penmanship wasted? Megan Regan states that the most important skill is the investment of time in itself, the pursuit of perfection, and makes the case that there is a connection between the pursuit of perfect penmanship and the skills brought to the labor market.

Penmanship reflects a time and a place, the country or year you were born, the language you speak, the alphabet you use. In the pre industrial revolution era, in the US the Spencer method was taught. This method took thousands of hours to perfect yet those who could write in the Specer method were labeled as "model citizens". The Spencer method was the script of business so people who wanted to comunicate in the world of business had to know the Spencer method.

After the industrial revolution, due to the technological and economic changes a new kind of penmanship method was required, a more efficient method meant to keep pace with the typewriter. It was called the Palmer method. 

Later on, in the 1970's, where information and global communication became the central point in business the last formal style of penmanship taught in the US came about, the Zaner-Bloser method. This utilitarian method focused on teaching manuscript first to allow earlier communication in children to reflect that the needs of the market at the time were all about communication.

Fast forward to today, penmanship is not necessarily taught in school anymore while cursive, if taught, is taught in the art department. So the question arises, was all the time invested in pursuing a perfect penmanship wasted? Empirical research on handwriting indicates that the written word is more eficcient in terms of memory and learning outcome than the typed word, so at least we can say that the written work still has relevance in our modern day.

People who have invested a lot of time in pursuing their perfect penmanship also wonder if their skills are now obsolete or no longer relevant for the labor market. Megan claims that the relevant skills for the labor market are the time you invest in yourself, those thousands of hours that you spend pursuing your perfection and not the penmanship itself.


## My thoughts

Megan Regan tries to make the case that there is a connection between the pursuit of perfect penmanship and the human capital. Along the talk she also presents several different questions such as if the time invested in pursuing a perfect penmanship was wasted or not, or if the people who have invested said time on perfecting their penmanship offer obsolete skills to the labor market.
However the only scientific proof she presents is the empirical research done on handwritten letter in regards to learning outcome and memory, which doesn't really adresses the main topic.
In the end the speaker claims, without any evidence, that the thousand of hours used in pursuit of perfect penmanship are not wasted due to fact that they were spent pursuing perfection, basically asserting her own statement by repeating it in a different intonation.
