The interaction with clients, vendors or fellow employees from other countries is now much more common and can be done without ever leaving the office. Evidently, this has led to an increase in interactions across the globe which in turn also brought to the surface the vast contrast in styles and expectations between cultures. For example, one study examined nearly 7500 questionnaire responses from managers and executives across 12 countries targetting 39 key personality traits, and compiled them into what they called \"The Big Five\": emotional balance, extroversion, consentiusness, agreableness and openness to new experiences. The authors of this study also noted that agreeableness and emotional balance account for the biggest disparities. For example, business leaders in the UK had among the lowest scores on agreeableness, received average scores in emotional balance while getting high scores in extroversion. On the other hand managers and executives in Japan scored high in emotional balance and very low in extroversion.
